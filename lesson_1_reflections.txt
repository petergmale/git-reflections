# How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- reduced overall lines to review
- lined up changes side-by-side
- indicated type of change +/-

# How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
# efficient programmer in the long term?

- review progression stages of design
- revisit code again which may spark another insightful change

# What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
# like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- pro: commit working code
- pro: able to choose a logical change
- con: may forget and lose work
- con: may tend to grow a change that is beyond a logical change

# Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
# in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- efficient to track dependent files together if common changes
- easier to revert
- better to see logical change encompassing commit

# How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log <file>
- git dif <hash1> <hash2>   The <hash> is the id; shortcut by using only 4 or more chars

# How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
# break something?
- can easily revert back
- changes wont affect others until after commit; changes stay local

# Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- eventually, want to share code with son for sw coding
- also, working on code material for systemverilog/UVM lectures
