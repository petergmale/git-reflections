# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- creates a '.git' file with metadata
- this is a way git knows what to track

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
# What value do you think it offers?
- like a local repository that holds transition changes?
- allows you to collect logical changes.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- only stage files belonging to a logical change.

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
# How would branches help?
- git log will show history of that branch, keeping history organized. Not sure about when
  it gets merged tho.
- branches allow you to switch to a new focus of changes. Later, that branch can be merged.

# How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- by following the diagrams, you can visualize the reachability and path of a branch commit
